# Rev.1-2R266

I'm reformatting the Duet firmware so it's easier to read and doesn't contain the previous Rev.0 configuration...which was previously just commented out. We'll need to include Rev.1 firmware in the new Rev.1 Image/OctoPrint plugin in order for our OctoPrint "Overwrite Duet Configuration" button to work properly. We use that button in the production process and customers use it to revert their firmware back to it's original state.
